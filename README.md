# Incompressable Fluid Flow

The code I built is just a simple simulation of how your fluid would behave if you moved below it a slide. It was just a fun project I did after I got mentally worn out from my Fluid Dynamics Coursework. At the moment, it was just a simple way of appreciating my hard work by seeing it come to life. I have to solve some analytical problems and study the flow behaviour to get this. But the code is just a simple implementation: solving the differential equation and putting a frame rate on it to show it would behave as time is going on. 

You can access the Jupiter Notebook file for a more formal illustration, as I have written all the critical information in much more detail.
